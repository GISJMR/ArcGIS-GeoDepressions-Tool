# ArcGIS-GeoDepressions-Tool
James M Roden

An ArcGIS toolbox to semi-automatically identify and analyse geo-depressions in a bathymetric grid. These tools can be used to aid the discovery of pockmarks on the sea bed, and ultimately the location of working hydrocarbon systems.

## Pockmarks

Pockmarks, or seafloor depressions are often associated with fluid discharge and are regarded as indicators of focused fluid seepage. First detailed by King & Maclean (1970); they suggest that gas from underlying bedrock was released sufficiently enough to put fine grain material into suspension. As this sediment drifts away from the venting point it results in a depression in the sea floor. The shape and size of pockmarks can vary greatly, however there are some relatively common traits. Hovland et al (2002) devised several morphological categories. The most common are:
* A unit pockmark (1-10m in diameter, up to 0.5m deep)
* 'Normal' pockmarks (10-700m in diameter, up to 45m deep)
* Elongate pockmarks (Similar to normal pockmarks except one axis is considerably longer)
This toolbox should facilitate in helping detect potential pockmarks at varying scales depending on the quality and resolution of the input bathymetry. 

## Identify GeoDepression Tool

Identifies depressions in a bathymetric raster using the specified z-value (difference between sink and pour point). The z-value parameter is a threshold for what sinks should be filled in the raster. A sink is a cell in the raster that has no outward flow direction (i.e. a depression). If the sink depth to pour point height is less than the specified z-value, the sink will be identified; otherwise it will be ignored. Ideally this tool will be run several times with differing z-values to capture all possible depressions. For e.g. depressions that are ~5m deep would be ignored if they were located inside a depression that is ~20m deep if the z-value was >20m. A suggested work-flow is to loop over several z-values (e.g. [3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15]) and using 'Select by Location' in ArcMap remove the larger polygons if they contain polygons from a smaller z-value. At this stage spurious polygons from edge data and/or noise can also be removed. Once happy with the depressions polygon it can be used in the Analyse Tool to get the various statistics that will support any interpretation.

### Algorithm Outline:

1. Use ArcGIS Spatial Analysis Fill tool to fill all sinks within z-value range
1. Subtract newly created fill raster from original bathymetry raster layer. Resulting layer is a depressions raster
1. Reclassify depressions raster and convert to polygons
1. Calculate area and remove all depression polygons that fall outside of the specified range. The minimum area is pre-defined as (cellsize*3)Â² to allow enough raster resolution to delineate a shape

## Analyse GeoDepressions Tool

Analyses z-value polygons from Identify Geo-Depressions tool. Produces polygon set with the following analytic statistics: area, perimeter, major axis, minor axis, eccentricity, azimuth, thinness ratio, diameter-depth ratio, depression depth, and low-level morpholgical characteristics. The tool outputs 3 feature classes: depression polygons, depression polygon centroids, and depression polygon deepest point.

### Algorithm Outline:

1. Calculate the location of deepest point using ArcGIS Spatial Analysis Zonal Statistics and Raster Calculator
1. Smooth Polygons for better aesthetics using cellsize*3 PAEK smoothing algorithm
1. Calculate Area, Perimeter, Major Axis, Minor Axis, Eccentricity, Azimuth, Thinness Ratio, and Diameter-Depth Ratio for each polygon
