# ArcGIS-GeoDepressions-Tool

An ArcGIS toolbox to semi-automatically identify and analyse geo-depressions in a bathymetric grid. These tools can be used to aid the discovery of pockmarks on the sea bed, and ultimately the location of working hydrocarbon systems.

Pockmarks, or seafloor depressions are often associated with fluid discharge and are regarded as indicators of focused fluid seepage. First detailed by King & Maclean (1970); they suggest that gas from underlying bedrock was released sufficiently enough to put fine grain material into suspension. As this sediment drifts away from the venting point is results in a depression in the sea floor. The shape and size of pockmarks can vary greatly, however there are some relatively common traits. Hovland et al (2002) devised several morphological categories. The most common are:
* A unit pockmark (1-10m in diameter, up to 0.5m deep)
* 'Normal' pockmarks (10-700m in diameter, up to 45m deep)
* Elongate pockmarks (Similar to normal pockmarks except one axis is considerably longer)
